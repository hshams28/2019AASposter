Jointcal is a new software package developed for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) to optimize the astrometric and photometric calibrations of a set of mosaic camera images of an area of sky. The Jointcal algorithm incorporates object matching both between exposures and to external reference catalogs, and produces more accurate distortion and throughput models than if the astrometry and photometry were fit on the individual exposures. This is especially true when the images are significantly deeper than those of the reference catalogs (for example, LSST's 30-second r-band exposure depth will be 24.7 compared with r < 20 for Gaia's final survey depth). The Jointcal package is part of the LSST Science Pipelines, and can operate on any mosaic camera that can be processed by the LSST software, including CFHT Megacam, DECam, Subaru Hyper SuprimeCam (HSC), and simulated LSST images from phosim and imsim.
