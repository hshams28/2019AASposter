Jointcal is an LSST Science Pipelines software package to optimize the astrometric and photometric calibrations of a set of mosaic camera images of an area of sky.
The Jointcal algorithm matches both between exposures and to external reference catalogs; this allows many more sources to be fit when the images are significantly deeper than those of the reference catalogs (for example, LSST's 30-second r-band exposure depth will be 24.7 compared with r < 20 for Gaia's final survey depth).
Jointcal can operate on any camera that can be processed by the LSST software, including CFHT Megacam, DECam, Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), and simulated LSST images from phosim and imsim.


and produces more accurate distortion and throughput models than if the astrometry and photometry were fit on the individual exposures.

The Jointcal package is part of the , and
