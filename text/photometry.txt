Shown is jointcal's photometric calibration of one HSC exposure (one scale factor per CCD, times a 7th order chebyshev polynomial per visit), with the single frame processing pipeline calibration (`processCcd`: one scale factor per CCD per exposure) divided out, to show the components of the photometry fit by jointcal. The largest deviations are at the edges of the focal plane, where HSC is significantly vignetted. There are also variations at the >2% level in the middle of the focal plane.
