Here is Jointcal's photometric calibration of one HSC exposure (one scale factor per CCD, times a 7th order chebyshev polynomial per visit), with the single frame algorithm (processCcd) divided out.
The largest deviations are at the edges of the focal plane, where HSC is significantly vignetted.
The middle of the focal plane also has variations at the >2% level.
