Here we demonstrate jointcal's astrometric and photometric calibration performance on HSC data (102 ccds), with 45 exposures of one field (XMM-WIDE HSC-I band).
We fit a 7th order polynomial per visit over the whole focal plane, and an affine transformation (2d rotation, translation and scale) for each sensor (fixd for all observations).
Residuals are markedly reduced on the edges of ccds, where the focal plane polynomial and more available sources allow the model to not diverge at the edge.
