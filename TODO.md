Notes
-----

Plot comparison with reference catalog jointcal vs. processCcd.

Compare RA/Dec positions of jointcal vs. processCcd and plot amplitude of shift per "cell".

Plot AM1/PA1 as histograms (no outlier fraction). Flattened across all tracts?

Questions
---------
Remove pass/fail metric lines from the plots?


TODO
----
* Update histogram plots to use WIDE data on lsst-dev. Flatten across multiple tracts?
